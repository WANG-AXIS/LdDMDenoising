# Impact of loss functions on the performance of a deep neural network designed to restore low-dose digital mammography

======

This repository contains the training and testing codes for the paper "[Impact of loss functions on the performance of a deep neural network designed to restore low-dose digital mammography](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2023.102555)". For simulating dose reduction on clinical images, we used the codes available [here](https://lucasbusp.wixsite.com/lucasborges/simulation-of-dose-reduction). Also, we used a model-based (MB) restoration as a benchmark, also available [here](https://lucasbusp.wixsite.com/lucasborges/image-restoration), which uses the commonly known [BM3D](https://webpages.tuni.fi/foi/GCF-BM3D/).
